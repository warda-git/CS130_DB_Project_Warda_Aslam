# CS130_DB_Project_Warda_Aslam
This project entails the development of a browser-based Inventory Management System tailored for small-scale retailers and shop owners. The system simplifies the process of tracking and maintaining stock levels by offering capabilities such as adding new items, modifying product information, removing outdated entries, and reviewing the current inventory. Additionally, it includes a built-in mechanism to alert users when the quantity of a product drops below a predefined threshold.
Upon successful completion, this project is expected to deliver:
•	A fully operational web application for small-scale inventory management.
•	Secure and structured storage of inventory data within a MySQL database.
•	An intuitive front-end interface that promotes ease of use.
•	Enhanced understanding of PHP-MySQL integration and the CRUD application model in practice.
Conclusion
This inventory management system is designed not only to assist shopkeepers in maintaining real-time stock control but also to serve as a practical learning exercise for connecting server- side scripts with a relational database. It reflects key concepts in database operations and user interaction through a web-based interface, making it a strong foundation for more complex inventory solutions in the future
